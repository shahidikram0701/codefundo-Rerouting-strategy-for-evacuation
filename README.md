# codefundo-Rerouting-strategy-for-evacuation
Problem Domain : 

  The problem we address is mainly concerned with effective flood and heavy rainpour management and mitigation and control.

Problems being addressed:
	
  To solve the difficulties of the emergency vehicles travel on the complex structure road network .
  To warn the areas which are most likely to be affected by floods soon and evacuate them early , preventing a disaster.
  To solve the location identification problem. 
  To know the close rescue teams and emergency service for disaster area.
  To provide the best evacuation route between the locations of emergency services and the disaster location.

Subproblems being addressed:
	Our solution mainly includes these  components
      1).
      Evaluation of the scenario and effective evacuation strategy finding by considering roadblocks, river overruns. It             includes computation of the nearest relief place with shortest time.the area is mapped as a graph and every update can be       kept track to reroute effectively and making the evacuation more productive thereby saving thousands of lives.
      2).
      As a precautionary measure we can evaluate the current rain scenario and river flow rates and find out all the low lying       areas around the river to evacuate the areas using the altitude data of the river, previous history which is likely to         be flooded with this rainfall rate and evacuate the area , preventing the problem.
